The streamlo system was created for my final year project at university

#### OSX/Windows

1.	Install nodejs / v5.0^ (and greater) (To get NPM) (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2.	Navigate to downloaded repository directory in CLI
3.	Run “npm install”
4.	Run "npm install -g gulp"
5.	Run "gulp"
6.	Go to “http://localhost:9010/" in browser
7.	In order to communicate with a locally hosted web server you will need to run google chrome in low security mode due to HTTP access control (CORS) (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS). 
8.	This can be achieved using the following command (Windows) “C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe --args -disable-web-security --user-data-dir“. (OSX) "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google/Chrome --args -disable-web-security --user-data-dir".
9.	Please note all other chrome windows must be closed before this is run. Also note your install location for google Chrome may be different.
